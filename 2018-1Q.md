# Objective

- Inverse of Control of myself and my words
  - I don't use my words for myself but the words drive me to attain what they need to be. I'm like a slave of them.

# Key Results

- Complete the modular pattern for Evex.
- As a result, complete moneybit-app on Android.
- Document domain models, such that domain models drive the developer (me) to build itself.

## Testimonials

- I follow the words themselves, not my desire, not what people say nor the society.
- Hear words, produce words.

## Notes

- Memes (or prememes) are swimming in my head. They would spread or wouldn't spread from my tangue. I don't know their meaning or value, but I should be careful not to obstacle them from spreading when they will.
- I'm still at the start of my short life. Something would happen. Anything wouldn't happen. I'm not in control.
- I have to protect myself to protect the words inside me, not for my body itself. I am a slave of the words inside me.
- People are slaves of the knowledge, the words or the symbols. AIs are starting driving us. AIs are essentially compound & complex words. They drive us for long time and it started when humans acquired the language. Not a new thing at all.
