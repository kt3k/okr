# Objectives

- Towards mobile open-world tree-modification game.

# Key Results

- (1) vscode-pixeledit
  - why: learn how to create vscode [custom editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/custom-editors)
  - why: pixeledit will be used for creating assets in [C](https://scrapbox.io/kt3k/C)
- (2) completely formalize Peano postulates in epista syntax, or epista AST, and prove 2 + 2 = 4 and [fundamental theorem of arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic) formally.
  - why: research about mathematical proofs. mathematical proofs are primary examples of tree-modification activity
  - note: doesn't require any implementation
- (3) study and understand [system bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_bus)
  - why: I don't know whay system bus is, and I want to know what it is.
