# Objective

- Follow the words, not myself, not any person.

# Key Results

- a. Know what domain models are, write down about them.
- b. Construct infrastructure to document capsid components (capsid-kit).
- c. Finish Journal screen of moneybit-app

## Notes

- `capsid-kit` is a tool for testing, documenting and releasing the capsid modules.
- Need to concentrate more on words, not on potatoes or tomatoes.
- Everything is not so important except words themselves.
- The reality is, ironically, not real at all. All you see as "the real world" is the noise which your nerve system has been creating. However what you say (= words) exist when you say them and the correlation of the words exist there and are real.

# Assessments

- a. 0.0
  - I didn't do it. I don't understand why it's important. This is the effort towards the more rubust development process, but in my view, my development process is now already too robust and there is no need of developing it further. Rather I put the key result of the opposite direction in the next quarter.
- b. 0.0
  - This is also the development of the development process. No need of these kind of the effort. This slows down the development of the actual process, and therefore is the obstacle for the true purpose.
- c. 0.6
  - Created many components for that screen. Still in the course of making it. Had lots of benefits from the development of this development.
