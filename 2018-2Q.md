# Objective

- Follow the words, not myself, not any person.

# Key Results

- Know what domain models are, write down about them.
- Construct infrastructure to document capsid components (capsid-kit).
- Finish Journal screen of moneybit-app

## Notes

- `capsid-kit` is a tool for testing, documenting and releasing the capsid modules.
- Need to concentrate more on words, not on potatoes or tomatoes.
- Everything is not so important except words themselves.
- The reality is, ironically, not real at all. All you see as "the real world" is the noise which your nerve system has been creating. However what you say (= words) exist when you say them and the correlation of the words exist there and are real.
